The goal of this API is to facilitate more interaction between colleagues and promote team bonding(In this time of COVID-19 this may be useful for coping with the new way of working).

This is backend API was built with Java/Spring-Boot & Postgres,documented with Swagger, deployed on heroku. View [Docs](djdc).
